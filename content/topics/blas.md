* **BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)**
* The original **BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)** is strictly for **dense** linear algebra operations.
* Levels 1, 2, and 3 (vector, matrix-vector, matrix-matrix ops) assume dense storage and operate on full arrays â€” no support for [[sparse matrices|sparse matrix]] formats.
