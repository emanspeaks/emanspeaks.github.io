*Insight from the world's greatest mediocrity.*

This site is an attempt to document Randy's musings and coding experiment ideas.
Don't expect fully-baked ideas here.  Information will be organized as time allows
and as structure emerges naturally, but new information will generally be captured
in daily [[journal/index|journal entries]] and [[topics/index|topic]] pages.
Feel free to use the search bar to navigate rather than click through these
godforsaken cobwebs from my brain.
